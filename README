HELP
=====

This is a simple help system.
It shows a tree view of avaliable help and a display area for the selected help.

You can create the help frame by two methods:

HelpFrame frame = new HelpFrame(String, String);
HelpFrame frame = new HelpFrame(String, String, boolean);

The first creates the frame with the path and name and automatically sets the frame visible.
The second creates the frame with the path and name but allows you to not show the frame.
If you choose not to display the frame on creation then you will need to call setVisable(true)
on the created JFrame.

File structure:
Help files are read from path + name + File.separator.
Where path and name are the two String arguments passed to the constructor.
You can have as many files and directories as you want but only files ending in .html or .htm
will be read. Any file that is hidden (starts with a .) will not be shown.
If the user selects a directory from the tree view then the index.html file for that dir
will be shown. If this file is missing then a sorry message will be displayed informing
the user that no help is avaliable for that dir.

Default Text:
If you place an index.html file in the root dir then it will be shown on startup.
If you don't then a short message saying "Welcome, this is help for name" and a
link to my GitHub.

Pro Tip:
You can set your own image to be displayed in place of the default one.
use frame.setIconImage(img).
You can read an image from file with
Image img = ImageIO.read(new File("/dir/file.jpg"));


Thanks.
